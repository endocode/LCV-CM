# Artistic is artistic-1.0-perl, try to catch it!
# BSD contains the Clause word after the version number - which is not including .0 or .1
# bzip versions are in the format 1.0.5 or 1.0.6.
# still you are not catching classpath with this logic
# MIT CMU will be hardly recognized
# MPL no copyleft cannot be recognized with this method
# MS-PL (Microsoft Public License) and MS-RL (Microsoft Reciprocal License) cannot be recognized
# Unicode DFS 2015 and 2016 currently cannot be re-composed.
# zlib-acknowledgement can be matched only with hyphen in the middle, inasmuch zlib is written equally.
